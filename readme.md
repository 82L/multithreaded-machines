# Les Machines

## Context
This project is initially an assignment made for my studies in 2018.
The goal was to prove proficiency in OO languages and in multithreading.

As it is a short project, made in C#, and with a interesting structure, I reworked it to see and showcase my improvements in development.

In this few hours refactoring, I :
- Dropped most of the french
- Debugged a little mistake
- Refactored a lot of the code, for a cleaner architecture, more flexible

## Launch
